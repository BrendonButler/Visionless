# Visionless
Since I can't seem to figure out Java graphics (maybe I'm just not learning it properly). I plan to create a text-based battle simulator inspired by [TextFighter](http://www.textfighter.tk) created & maintained by [hhaslam11](https://github.com/hhaslam11).

There's a lot to do, and I feel like it will be a lot of fun, as well as a great learning experience. Hopefully you'll think so too!

Throughout my journey I will implement cool and new ideas into this project. Hopefully, I'll also be able to improve my API: [ModestAPI](http://code.sparkzz.net/modestapi/)
