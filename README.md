# Visionless
Since I can't seem to figure out Java graphics (maybe I'm just not learning it properly). I plan to create a text-based battle simulator inspired by [TextFighter](http://www.textfighter.tk) created & maintained by [hhaslam11](https://github.com/hhaslam11).

I will be using [ModestAPI](http://code.sparkzz.net/modestapi/), a console-based game API that is intended to assist beginner developers as well as experienced developers by implementing commonly used and difficult to implement systems that are all handled by the API. If you are looking to develop your own games, hopefully you will try out [ModestAPI](http://code.sparkzz.net/modestapi/), and even use this game as a resource to better understand how the API works!
